# NSURS-HER-ML

**UPDATE: As of 5/2/2023, this project is almost fully operational with minimal script changes needed**

## Purpose

Welcome to the NSURS-HER-ML project! This repository is part of an undergraduate project titled "Screening of Highly Active Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Catalysts: Comparative Analysis of Typical Machine Learning Methods". You can read my paper and check out my presentation on this GitHub as well.

## Features

The NSURS-HER-ML project provides several features to make it easy for you to generate materials data, import training data, build models, compare models, and predict materials. Some of the key features of this project are:

- Generate a CSV of materials with descriptors to later predict
- Train models and save outputs to CSV
- Generate statistics and graphs for models
- Import descriptors from materials database
- TPOT and Ludwig Auto-ML pipeline

## To-Do

We are continuously improving the NSURS-HER-ML project to make it more efficient and user-friendly. Some of the tasks we are currently working on include:

- Check association values between descriptors
- Optimize models
- Add more comments
- Add examples of what project can do

## Abstract

Abstract
Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts play a critical role in renewable energy technologies such as hydrogen production. Identifying novel catalysts with high efficiency and low cost is a significant challenge. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of supervised machine learning techniques for screening HER catalysts. 

We applied various machine learning models to predict the probability of a list of 300 transition metal borides, carbides, and nitrides being a highly efficient HER catalyst. Elemental descriptors that can be easily obtained by the periodic table for Metal (M) and carbon, nitrogen, boron (X) were primarily used. Materials with published Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (Î”GH*) values were utilized for our training data. We compared the different machine learning models based on root mean square error (RMSE), speed of model generation, and speed of model prediction. 

Our results showed that the Random Forest Regression model produced the lowest testing RMSE and was chosen to examine the 300 materials, Out of which 29 materials were predicted to be high-performance HER catalysts. Our approach can efficiently identify promising HER catalysts with high accuracy, providing guidance for further experimental and theoretical investigations.
