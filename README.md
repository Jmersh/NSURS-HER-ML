# NSURS-HER-ML

As of 11/7/2022 this project is baseline operational.

Purpose:
For use in undergraduate project titled

"Screening of Highly Active Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Catalysts: Comparative Analysis of Typical Machine Learning Methods"

This project generates a CSV of materials, imports training data, builds models with the training data, compares the models, and predict materials.


Features:

Generates CSV of materials with descriptors to later predict

Trains models and saves outputs to CSV

Generates statistics on models

Generates graphs for models

Other cool stuff I am forgetting



To-Do:

[ ] implement mp-api and extend descriptors to space group, lattice params, etc.

[ ] Rename Github Project

[ ] Check association values between descriptors

[ ] Optimize models

[ ] Add more comments

[ ] Automate final steps (screen predicted energy for value range)

[ ] Add examples of what project can do

[ ] Add project paper and presentation to Github

[ ] Finish a ton of stuff
